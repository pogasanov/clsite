I am also on the faculty of the Torcuato Di Tella Law School.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the my career since I was 21 has been connecting Latin America and the United States, two cultures that I understand on a deep level. On the Latin American side, I grew up in Buenos Aires, was the valedictorian of the Di Tella Law School, I\u2019ve been an associate at a law firm in Buenos Aires and have resolved complex international cases. On the American side, I received my Masters in Law from Stanford and lived in Silicon Valley, I was a research fellow at Columbia and lived in New York, I\u2019ve been working with American companies for a decade \u2014 and, perhaps most importantly, my husband and two children are American.",
